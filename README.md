Class homework assignment for The coding Boot Camp at The University of Texas at Austin Center for professional Education (Fall 2016)

### The Assignment
In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

### Instructions

* Create a game that suits this user story:
  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

### Solution

I created a rock, paper, scissors game utlizing Firebase that allows for multile games between two players to run simultaneously. It racks the Win/Loss record of each player during the game. Visually, I wanted to keep it minimalist and simple to mirror the simplicity and 'schoolyard' nature of the game.

The design is also responsive allowing it to be played easily on mobile devices.

I did not add chat functionality.
